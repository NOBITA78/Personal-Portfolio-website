## Project Workflow

This is a static portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript.

- The "index.html" file is the main entry point that loads the complete website.
- The "style.css" file styles all sections (Home, About, Projects, Contact, etc.).
- Optional "JavaScript" files may add interactivity like button effects or form validation.
- The website is fully responsive and adjusts layout based on screen size.
- Images and assets are stored in the `/images` folder.
- The project can be hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify for free.

No backend or database is involved ‚Äì the site is lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy.
